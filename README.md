# Interactive-Video-Player

Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

In this project, I built an HTML5 video player using JavaScript and the HTML5 Video API. Using the supplied mockups, video files, and transcript, I built an interactive video player that synchronizes the video and the transcript. The transcript highlights as the video progresses, and when a user clicks any part of the transcript, it takes them to the appropriate place in the video.
